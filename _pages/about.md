Welcome to my personal Blog. This website is a collection of notes and procedures, technical stuff and personal toughts on modern technologies.

I'm a Web Designer, front-end developer, tech enthusiast. Initially I created this website just as an archive for my code snippets, documents and guides that I often use during my web projects.
Initially I decided to put everything on the web for my reference, in an easy and organized manner, to have them at hand, now the site became a blog of my activities and first of all a knowledge sharing platform dedicated to web design and technology lovers.
