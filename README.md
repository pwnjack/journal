#### Break the code

My personal blog

I decided to migrate from Wordpress to Jekyll, 'cause why not.

Pros:
- I can write in markdown
- I can publish on the internet with a git push
- Free hosting at github-pages
- Free domain at github-pages
- No virus/malwere/hacking possible cause it's static
- Profit

Cons:
- Not so much features/plugins 'cause it's less popular than Wordpress
- Some limitations (not that many)

Anyway it isn't missing anything that I need for my blog. So let's go for it.

## Make it work

Clone this repo, install dependencies (for Jekyll) and start the local env:

    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll serve

Edit site, when finished push changes to remote repository and wait for gh-pages to publish them. Done.

Now I have my completely-free online blog. Awesome.
