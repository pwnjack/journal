Google introduced the concept of material design, very effective minimal design that resembles real world material.

There's a framework out there called <a href="http://materializecss.com/" target="_blank">MaterializeCSS</a>, it's very well done and offers a lot of features, including some of the more modern plugins like parallax, responsive videos, sliders and much much more, even more features than Bootstrap, his most famous alternative.

Maybe it's not a mature framework yet, but it's very well done, give it a try!
