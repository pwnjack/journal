Google introduced the concept of material design, very effective minimal design that resembles real world material.

There&#8217;s a framework out there called <a href="http://materializecss.com/" target="_blank">MaterializeCSS</a>, it&#8217;s very well done and offers a lot of features, including some of the more modern plugins like parallax, responsive videos, sliders and much much more, even more features than Bootstrap, his most famous alternative.

Maybe it&#8217;s not a mature framework yet, but it&#8217;s very well done, give it a try!
