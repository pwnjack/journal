The CSS selectors are important so it's a good practice to familiarize with them, let's understand how they work.

    element

This is the default selector, you can use any html element like p, a, body, html, h1, etc.

    #id

The id is unique on your page, so use this only if you want to use it once on you page.

   .class

The most common, like id but can be used multiple times in your page, i almost use only calsses.

   *

The asterisk select

   .class p

This will select the descendant child p of the indicated class.

    p

Like the example above this, with the only difference that it will select only the first child, not the nested ones.

    .class + p

This will target the parent element, so in this example it will select the class that contains at least a p.

    .class:hover .class:focus .class:active

These are status selectors that will be applied respectively on the indicated status of the element, before or after it.

    ul ~ p

any p elements, as long as they follow a ul.

    a[title]

This is the attribute selector, it will select only the a element that have the indicated attribute.

    p::first-letter

These are pseudo-selectors indicated by the double colons (::). In this case it will target only the first letter of every paragraph.

Happy coding!
