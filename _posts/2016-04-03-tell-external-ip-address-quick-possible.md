Need to know your external ip address as quick as possible? I found this website to be the cleanest and fastest solution.

    http://icanhazip.com

I love it because it returns just plain text without ads or extra data.

This means that you can easily obtain the result from the terminal too, or programmatically, the geeks out there will love this (e.g.).

    curl http://icanhazip.com

I appreciate the small things in life.

Some extra goodies:

    # returns the reverse DNS record for you ip
    icanhazptr.com

    # returns a traceroute
    icanhaztrace.com

    # returns Epoch time (for real nerds)
    icanhazepoch.com

    # can determine if your traffic is being proxied
    icanhazproxy.com
