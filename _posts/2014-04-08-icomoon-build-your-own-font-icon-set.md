Icomoon is a cool online tool that let you build your own icon-font. An icon-font is a webfont for icons, instead of simple text, and is te best way to have pixel perfect, cross-browser, vectorial icons correctly embedded in your website, and you can use them exaclty like a normal font. Let&#8217;s see how it works.

Go on their website: <a title="Icomoon" href="http://icomoon.io" target="_blank">Icomoon</a> click on the upper-right corner on the &#8220;Icomoon App&#8221; button and start browsing the available icon&#8217;s libraries and select the icons you would like to implement in your project, if you can&#8217;t find all the icons you need you can easily add custom svg icons by clicking on the &#8220;Import Icons&#8221; button in the upper-left corner, and when you are satisfied you can choose how to export your icon set, in a font as said before, or in svg format. For the scope of this post we will choose the icon-font.

After downlading your package it will bundle a demo page and all the files that you need, simply put the contents of the fonts folder in your project and copy the code inside the generated style.css file in your&#8217;s. Featuring a fontface embed like any other web font you can know use your icons in your website as you wish, by simply adding a semanthicly named class to a span element for example and the icon will magically appear like a font, scalable and pixel perfect at any resolution, expacially good when on mobile devices.

Icomoon is the definitive tool for icon web fonts, give it a try, you won&#8217;t regret!

Happy coding!
