How to build a website from scratch? Here is a collection of common practices you have to follow when you want to start a website from zero. Keep in mind that we are talking about a static HTML page.

First of all, instead of doing this repetitive tasks every time, there's an useful tool on the web that does this for you, it's called <a title="Initializr" href="http://www.initializr.com/" target="_blank">Initializr</a>.

There you can start customizing a base template for building an HTML website, choose if you want to use a framework, like <a title="Bootstrap" href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> or <a title="Boilerplate" href="http://html5boilerplate.com/" target="_blank">Boilerplate</a>, or a responisive bundle.

This tool is very useful while starting new projects because has already embeded lot of useful files that usually you have to gather one by one, like jquery library, links in the header, links to js and css files and it also provides a nice folders structure to start with, it also includes <a title="Modernizr" href="http://modernizr.com/" target="_blank">Modernizr</a> another tool that optimize your HTML5 markup and CSS3 rules for older browser versions like IE7 (etc.).

From there you can start to write the HTML markup and customize the already existing files or add new ones with ease. For coding offcourse you will need a good text editor, my personal suggestions are:

For Mac: <a title="Sublime Text" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>  
For Windows: <a title="Notepad++" href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>

If you simply want to improve you coding skills with an easy interface and see the results of your code on the fly, try out <a title="Code Academy" href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Code Academy</a>, with this you need nothing else than your browser and an internet connection and you can test your code directly on your browser!

If you need a good tutorial to start with because all this it's too much for you, watch <a title="How to learn HTML and CSS in 30 days" href="http://freecourses.tutsplus.com/30-days-to-learn-html-and-css/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>, it's very good to understand the basics.

Have fun!
