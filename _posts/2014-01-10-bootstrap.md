Bootstrap from Twitter is an awesome front-end framework made for building awesome websites with easy-to-use built-in features. Download it <a title="Bootstrap" href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

On the Bootstrap webpage you&#8217;ll find all the instructions you need to use it, the awesome is that it includes a lot of features that usually web designers have to develop from scratch and they are ready-to-use and easy to customize for every need.

Inside Bootstrap you can find:

&#8211; Grid System  
&#8211; Typography  
&#8211; Tables  
&#8211; Forms  
&#8211; Buttons  
&#8211; Responsive features  
&#8211; Icon set  
&#8211; Navigation bars  
&#8211; Thumbnails

And it&#8217;s not over, there are also a lot of Javascript plugins like:

&#8211; Transitions  
&#8211; Modal  
&#8211; Dropdown menu  
&#8211; Scrollspy  
&#8211; Tabs  
&#8211; Buttons (with statuses like loading, in progress etc.)  
&#8211; Collapse  
&#8211; Slider  
&#8211; Affix

And much much more&#8230; They also offer a set of premade page templates you can start with almost for every need: sticky footer, sidebar, fullscreen etc. and you can use all this in any project you want, for free!

This way you don&#8217;t have to re-invent the wheel every time, but you have a solid base to start with, made to be easily customized and styled! Personally i use it everyday for all my projects since I discovered it, and know i can&#8217;t live without it, it saves you tons of time and let you focus more on the customization. Isn&#8217;t it awesome?

There are also other alternatives like <a title="Foundation" href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation</a> but personally i find <a title="Bootstrap" href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> better because it&#8217;s more easy to use and it&#8217;s made for nerds by nerds!

Have fun!
