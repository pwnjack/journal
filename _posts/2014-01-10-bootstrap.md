Hey devs, I present to you **The Frontend Framework**,

Bootstrap from Twitter is an awesome front-end framework made for building awesome websites with easy-to-use built-in features. Download it <a title="Bootstrap" href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

On the Bootstrap webpage you'll find all the instructions you need to use it, the awesome is that it includes a lot of features that usually web designers have to develop from scratch and they are ready-to-use and easy to customize for every need.

Inside Bootstrap you can find:

- Grid System  
- Typography  
- Tables  
- Forms  
- Buttons  
- Responsive features  
- Icon set  
- Navigation bars  
- Thumbnails

And it's not over, there are also a lot of Javascript plugins like:

- Transitions  
- Modal  
- Dropdown menu  
- Scrollspy  
- Tabs  
- Buttons (with statuses like loading, in progress etc.)  
- Collapse  
- Slider  
- Affix

And much much moreâ€¦ They also offer a set of premade page templates you can start with almost for every need: sticky footer, sidebar, fullscreen etc. and you can use all this in any project you want, for free!

This way you don't have to re-invent the wheel every time, but you have a solid base to start with, made to be easily customized and styled! Personally i use it everyday for all my projects since I discovered it, and know i can't live without it, it saves you tons of time and let you focus more on the customization. Isn't it awesome?

There are also other alternatives like <a title="Foundation" href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation</a> but personally i find <a title="Bootstrap" href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> better because it's more easy to use and it's made for nerds by nerds!

Have fun!
