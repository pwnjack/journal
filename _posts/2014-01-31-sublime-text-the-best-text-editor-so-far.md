If you are a programmer, a web developer, or any code-oriented professionist you will need, for sure, a good text editor. There are plenty out there but the best one I ever tried is Sublime Text.

Why? Because it&#8217;s lightweight, super-fast and capable of  community driven plugins, the best you can get.

Just to give you an example of what you can do with Sublime Text take a look at <a title="Sublime Text" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">their website</a>, where you can also download it if you want to give it a try.

To have the full power out of the program tho, you&#8217;ll have to install some plugins. You can easily do this via the package control, a cool feature to manage them directly inside the program. Sublime Text community is huge and fast-growing and there are already lot of plugins for every programming language with lot of code snippets abbreviations, one of the coolest features of the text editor.

For example if you are a web designer like me you&#8217;ll find very useful some plugins for HTML, jQuery, CSS3 etc. The best plugin so far is called Emmet (formerly Zen Coding), it gives a lot of abbreviation that will save you tons of time while developing. Here is an <a title="Sublime Text plugin - Emmet" href="http://designshack.net/articles/css/7-awesome-emmet-html-time-saving-tips/" target="_blank">article</a> that explains a lot of it&#8217;s best features and with lot of examples, with even a try-box to test them!
