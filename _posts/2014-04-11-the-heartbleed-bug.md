This past 3 days we were all notified by companies emails about this bug, called Heartbleed, well it's a very serious issue, so better understand what this implies.

The bug affected an open source library called OpenSSL (encrypted transmission protocol) that's been used by a lot of major companies like Yahoo, Flickr and such, and it led to a vulnerability of such sites and all their stored data.

You can find the complete Heartbleed OpenSSL exploit right <a title="Heartbleed OpenSLL Vulnerability" href="http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/32998/" target="_blank">here</a>.

So, to be sure you and your personal informations are no longer affected by this issue, read on.

If you use the same password on some or even all of the websites you are registered on, please change them, and remember this is a good practice also before this bug's occurence.

I suggest you to use a good password manager that helps you with your password, because i understand that remember all different passwords is almost impossible, here is the best one in my opinion (<a title="Dashlane" href="https://www.dashlane.com/" target="_blank">Dashlane</a>).

I wrote <a title="Dashlane Post" href="http://pwnjack.com/tired-of-forgetting-all-your-passwords-the-solution-is-a-password-manager/" target="_blank">this post</a> some time ago that explains how it works and why it's good to use it.

If you follow these instructions and change your password with new, strong, password you'll be 100% safe. So better do it asap!

You welcome.
