Every developer struggles with CSS at some point in his career, and everyone starts to hate it. Well, CSS isn't that bad, you are just doing it wrong.

To build up scalable, maintainable and flexible CSS code you need to follow some rules, following the convention always comes in handy later on, and you will soon or late understand why.

You have to style your markup elements following some principles that in the long-term will give you huge benefits. To structure your CSS follow these 3 techniques:

- <a href="https://smacss.com/" target="_blank">SMACSS</a>  
- <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/" target="_blank">OOCSS</a>  
- <a href="http://blog.decaf.de/2015/06/24/why-bem-in-a-nutshell/" target="_blank">BEM</a>

Also, i suggest you to learn <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>, a powerful CSS preprocessor with real programming language features to assist you with the job.

By following those principles you will end up having well-structured CSS code, easier to maintain and re-use in your project, without ending up repeating yourself with messy code.

Here's a nice <a href="https://mattstauffer.co/blog/organizing-css-oocss-smacss-and-bem" target="_blank">article</a> that explains how to use them together, very accurately, and with some nice examples.

It will take you some time to get used to it, but trust me, it's totally worth it.

Happy coding with SMOOMS (SMACSS, OOCSS, BEM, Sass). 😉
