Ever wondered why OSX is missing some very useful CLI programs like "wget" or "nmap"?

Well, no one cares why, but here's the solution: <a href="http://brew.sh/index.html" title="Homebrew" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>, a package manager for OSX.

To install Homebrew open your terminal and run:

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

Ta dah.

Now how to use it (e.g.):

    brew install wget

And voil√†, you are covered.

Don't sudo, it's not needed, Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into /usr/local. So you don't need to use sudo.

Enjoy!
