Ever wondered why OSX is missing some very useful CLI programs like &#8220;wget&#8221; or &#8220;nmap&#8221;?

Well, no one cares why, but here&#8217;s the solution: <a href="http://brew.sh/index.html" title="Homebrew" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>, a package manager for OSX.

To install Homebrew open your terminal and run:

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
</pre>

Ta dah.

Now how to use it (e.g.):

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">brew install wget
</pre>

And voil√†, you are covered.

Don&#8217;t sudo, it&#8217;s not needed, Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into /usr/local. So you don&#8217;t need to use sudo.

Enjoy!
