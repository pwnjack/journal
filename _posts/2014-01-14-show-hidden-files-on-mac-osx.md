Sometimes is useful to show hidden files on Mac, altough there is no option for doing that, for security reasons.

If you need to show the hidden files, the files starting whit a dot (.), like .htaccess and such, you can open the Terminal and paste this code strings in it.

The first one is to show hidden files, the second one to hide them again.

For OSX 10.9:

    defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
    defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE

For OSX 10.8 and earlier:

    defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
    defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE

After that, you need to reset the Finder with this command:

    killall Finder
