Docker is simply awesome.

Need a virtual machine? 1 command, literally ONE command.

    docker run -it ubuntu

BAM, you're in.

Yes. Inside an Ubuntu virtual machine, up and running. Don't believe me? Try to:

    uname -a

Gotcha.

Imagine the possibilites! Endless, find out more here:[Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Future is here boys, have fun. ðŸ˜‰
