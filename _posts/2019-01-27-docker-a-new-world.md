Docker is simply awesome.

Need a virtual machine? 1 command, literally ONE command.

<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">docker run -it ubuntu</pre>

BAM, you&#8217;re in.

Yes. Inside an Ubuntu virtual machine, up and running. Don&#8217;t believe me? Try to:

<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">uname -a</pre>

Gotcha.

Imagine the possibilites! Endless, find out more here:[Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Future is here boys, have fun. ðŸ˜‰
