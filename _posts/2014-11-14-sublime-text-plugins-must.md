Here is a list of Sublime Text 3 plugins that you MUST have, or at least know about, because believe me, they will save you a lot of time.

**- Emmet**  
This plugin is awesome, formerly called Zen Coding, Emmet gives you awesome snippets functionality, but let me show you how it works:  
If for istance in my markup (HTML) I need an header with a navigation menu and some classes you can do it this way:

    header>nav>ul>li*4>a[href="#"]

Press TAB and it will render as:

    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#"></a></li>
        <li><a href="#"></a></li>
        <li><a href="#"></a></li>
        <li><a href="#"></a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    </header>

Awesome, isn't it?

Imagine when you get used to this how much time you could save while writing your markup.

**- Less/Sass**

If you use a CSS pre-processor, and i believe you do, you have to install this plugins to enable syntax highlighting for those languages.

**- Color Highlighter**

This plugin highlights the color codes with the respective color, for example if i select #000 in my code, it will be wrapped by a black glow, very useful to know what color is a given code, super useful.

**- jQuery Snippets**

A collection of snippets for jQuery development that gives you nice suggestions while typing your code, to go as smooth as possible.

**- Bootstrap 3 Snippets**

Are you a Twitter Bootstrap user? This plugins will allow you to never go back to the web docs to copy-paste code snippets, infact it gives you them all on the fly while typing, like:

    bs3-input:email

Will render as:

    <div class="input-group">
    <span class="input-group-addon"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></i></span>
    <input id="email" type="text" class="form-control" name="email" placeholder="Email">
    </div>

Sweet.

**- Sidebar Enhancements**

This plugin enhance your sidebar giving you a lot of right-click options for files, like: duplicate, remove, reveal in finder, show in your browser, etc. Very handful.

Set your workflow to be always painless and fun and you will love to code even more!

Enjoy
