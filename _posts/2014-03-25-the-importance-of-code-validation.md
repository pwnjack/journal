Now that i've finished my project, what's next?

Well it's a good practice before the official release of the "production" version to do some basic steps:

### <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">1. Testing</span>

After you've completed your tests, and by this i mean accurate tests, on all devices, all browsers and most importantly, all operative systems, then you are half way down; after you are almost sure that your website is being displayed as intended on every kind of device and operative system, then you have to check if your code is correct, because some times it's working but you may have forgot something.

### 2. Valdiation

To validate your code you have some tools that come in hand, for example this awesome website:

-<a title="W3C Validator" href="http://validator.w3.org" target="_blank">W3C Validator</a>

It's the official World Wide Web Authority's validation tool and using it is a breeze. You simply have to insert the link of your website and the tool will analyze your code and give back the results after few seconds, throwing up every error that need to be fixed, don't be scared if you receive "warnings" they are common false positives because of the new HTML5 standard not yet fully supported by the tool, but hey! keep that in mind.

Validating your code is a good practice to make sure it's working properly and in the correct way, pertinent with the web standards.

### 3. Publish!

Enojy!
