Every website have a footer, usually in the footer you should put informations like contacts, addresses, credits etc.

To create a footer in your website in the fastest and easiest way you can proceed as follows:

**Remember that your <footer> tag is an HTML5 element, so it will not be recognized in older browsers. And it must be inside the <body> tag.**

Give to the parent <div> a relative position, then set the footer to an absolute position and add also

    bottom: 0;

and give it a height and a background so you can see it. And that's pretty much everything, you got your footer!

For better understanding of the code and to re-create it by yourself, you can find a working example <a title="JsFiddle" href="http://jsfiddle.net/d9sYg/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Enjoy your coding.
