Remember <a href="http://pwnjack.com/yeoman-scaffolding-webapp-yo-gulp/" title="Yeoman, scaffolding your webapp with Yo and Gulp" target="_blank">Yeoman</a>? Our favorite scaffolding gentleman is gulp-ready, but unfortunately the actual gulp-generator supports only sass, but damn, I prefer less.

If you do too, you could find useful this gulp-less version I made, ready-to-go.

It contains:

&#8211; Gulp  
&#8211; Less  
&#8211; Bootstrap  
&#8211; HTML5 Boilerplate  
&#8211; Modernizr

Enojoy!
