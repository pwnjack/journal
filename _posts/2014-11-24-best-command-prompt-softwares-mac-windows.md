The default command prompts programs are absolutely incomplete and unusable by anyone who really needs a good terminal, so here is my choice of softwares for both: Mac and Windows.

**Mac**  
<a href="http://iterm2.com/" title="iTerm 2" target="_blank">iTerm 2</a>

**Windows**  
<a href="http://bliker.github.io/cmder/" title="Cmder" target="_blank">Cmder</a>

That&#8217;s all folks. Enjoy the cleanness.
