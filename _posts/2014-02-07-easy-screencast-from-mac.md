If you have a Mac and you need to do a screencast, or simply record your screen for instructional purposes, or anything else that is not in a full-screen app, you can do it with an OSX built in feature, without downloading any third party software, and the best part, it&#8217;s free!

How? Just open Quick Time Player, from the menu bar select File > New Screen Recording, at this point click on the record button and it will start to record anything you do on your screen, mouse pointer included, and when you are done, just select the STOP icon in the status bar (upper right).

You will find out that a video file appeared on your desktop, you are done!

Enjoy.
