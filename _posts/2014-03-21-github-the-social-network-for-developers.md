Github, who doesn't know it?

Well if you don't you are missing something big, something so useful that you will fall in love with it at the end of this article if you are a programmer like me.

Github developed for developers, tricky word joke, but true.

It's a website where you can upload your project and organize it with documentation, versions, brenches, and more.

It's the developers social network, where everyone can upload his repository and everyone can contribute to it, with suggestions, code snippets, reporting issues and make pull requests.

Their motto explains pretty much of it: "Building better software, together."

It's very useful when more than one people is working on a project to keep track of the updates, the modifies, the versions history, and much more. You can even use it from terminal once you installed their "rpm" (for the _redhatters_, git is the command in this case), To completely understand the potential of the software though, go to <a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">their website</a> and read up what you find there, it's pretty straight forward, and they explain everything better than me, for sure. This post is intended just as a suggestion for newbie developers that are looking for a good tool to manage their projects in collaboration with others, give it a try!
