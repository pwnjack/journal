Ever been asked to develop a custom design website, but WordPress-based?

If you are facing this struggle here is where you have to start from.

The best starting point to develop e a completely custom WordPress Theme is this: <a href="http://underscores.me/" target="_blank">Underscores</a> (or _S).

It's a skeleton template with some basic wordpress functionality integrations, ready to be worked on, to become your personal WP Theme.

Enjoy your WP Development. Happy coding! ðŸ™‚
