Maybe you are not the type of guy that needs this sort of tool but, hey, who didn't ever wanted a DESTROY button at hand.

There's Darik's Boot And Destroy (DBAN) a software that will completely destroy all the data inside your computer, even the operating system. It works this way: you can write inside an usb pendrive (or CD) the file image as a bootable device that you can run at computer start from the Boot Menu. Follow the <a href="http://www.dban.org" target="_blank">DBAN's official website</a> to download the official ISO image that you can burn on your pendrive (or CD).

Then boot up your computer, choose the drive as the boot device and the program will start, from there follow on-screen instructions to run the wipe. What it does? It simply write all zeroes on your hard drive to erase any chance of data-recovery. There are some more options to choose from for a even deeper wipe or just a fast scratch, you choose.

Enjoy!
