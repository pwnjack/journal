Hey folks,

There's an awesome tool out there called <a href="http://evernote.com/" title="Evernote" target="_blank">Evernote</a>, it's like a big collection of notes that you can keep synced across ALL your devices and easily accessible from everywhere, even on the website if you are on a stranger's computer.

It comes with an optional browser plugin (Chrome and Firefox), called <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/it/webclipper/" title="Evernote Web Clipper" target="_blank">Evernote Web Clipper</a>, that makes saving notes from the web as easy as a mouse click.

There's an Evernote for every platform out there and for every device too, it's awesome!

Never forget anything ever again with Evernote.

Enjoy
