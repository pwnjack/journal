<a href="https://popcorntime.io/" target="_blank">Popcorn Time</a> is the ultimate streaming application, it&#8217;s awesome and free.

Let&#8217;s see how to bring it&#8217;s awesomeness to your PS4 System and watch your favorite movies directly on your huge-sized television with no cable link needed. To do so we need another cool software: <a href="https://plex.tv/" target="_blank">Plex</a>.

Follow these simple steps:

&#8211; Install Popcorn Time on your computer  
&#8211; Install Plex on your computer

Open Popcorn Time and go to Settings, check &#8220;Show advanced settings&#8221;, scroll down and go to &#8220;Cache Directory&#8221; and set the path to a folder in your user&#8217;s Documents like: &#8220;/Users/username/Documents/PopcornTime&#8221; (Mac).

Then open Plex and add a new library using the plus sign in the left sidebar, select &#8220;Movies&#8221; and set the path to the same &#8220;Cache Directory&#8221; we just configured in Popcorn Time.

Now open the Terminal on your computer and type &#8220;ifconfig&#8221; (Mac), look at your IPv4 address and type it in your PS4&#8217;s internet browser, adding &#8220;:34000/home/index.html&#8221; at the end, like so:

(ex.)

<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">192.168.1.10:34000/home/index.html
</pre>

You will now see the Plex interface on your PS4, open the movie you want to watch on your computer and let it download in background, meanwhile the movie will appear on your ps4 Plex Library, ready to be watched.

Remember that you have to keep your computer downloading in background, in fact is your computer the one that is streaming data to your playstation4 trough the LAN, so it needs to continue his download while you watch the movie on your Play Station 4.

Awesome, isn&#8217;t it?

Enjoy Popcorn Time on your PS4 System.
