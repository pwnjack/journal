The website have been wiped out because we decided to switch to another hosting provider, faster and better. We decided to raise our standards to the next level and from now on we'll provide better contents and more interesting arguments, this way we can offer a wider service and fresher news to our (rare) visitors. Anyway this site is not intended to be popular but just as a collection of technical sheets and code snippets that usually are not so easy to find on the internet and as a starting point to help you customize your work and improve your web designing skills.

Upon the new year we'll start posting new contents and we'll have a lot of fun with the new arguments that we are ready to propose to you, fellas, stay tuned and be sure to not miss a thing!

As a start, I would like to start  this new age with the same phrase stated by the world's simplest program: "Hello world!"
