When you&#8217;ll need to start a new website&#8217;s front-end you&#8217;ll do some common-practice tasks that usually are repeated in every project and they are pretty annoying to be done again and again every single time, but hey, there&#8217;s a good news, there&#8217;s <a title="Initializr" href="http://www.initializr.com/" target="_blank">Initializr</a>, a nice web tool ready to help you.

Initializr is a web service that let you compile some options on a web interface and generates a downloadable web project solid base to start from. For example it creates a ready-to-go folder structure, divided in img/js/css and all that commons assets you&#8217;ll usually need in you project, and when you download the package it let you choose which frameworks you want to include in your project or not (like Bootstrap, a Responsive Template, etc.), or you if don&#8217;t need any you can simple choose to start with a standard HTML5 ready boilerplate template.

It&#8217;s very helpful so all the common practices are done and ready to go and you don&#8217;t need to re-invent the wheel every time but you can use it straight away and start to customize your project (the fun part) in no time.

Inside Initliazr Boilerplate base template you&#8217;ll find:

  * HTML — A guide to the default HTML.
  * CSS — A guide to the default CSS.
  * JavaScript — A guide to the default JavaScript.
  * .htaccess — All about the Apache web server configs.
  * crossdomain.xml — An introduction to making use of crossdomain requests.

Reduce the starting time of your web projects and go straight to the fun part!

Enjoy coding.
