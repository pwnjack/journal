You always wanted to have an internet radio to listen to, free and very versatile?

Then <a title="Pandora Internet Radio" href="http://www.pandora.com" target="_blank">Pandora </a>is for you. It haves a lot of features like creating a radio station based on a song, so you can continue to listen the same genre and maybe discover new favorite songs!

The bad news is that for legal purposes it's not yet available in all countries, so maybe not in yours.

But there's also a good news. Here's a trick you can do to listen to Pandora Radio anyway.  You simply have to install this plugin called Mediahint (it's available for Chrome and Firefox), you can download it on it's <a title="Media Hint" href="https://mediahint.com" target="_blank">official website</a>.

Music is life. Enjoy!
