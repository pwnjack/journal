I've got a lot of friends going crazy for this Supreme thing, they are bothered because they can't buy anything through the online store. It seems that as soon as something new comes out, it's gone after 15 seconds, the Supreme hype is real!

So they asked me for help, to find a way to buy on the Supreme online store and being able to catch the coolest drops without being scooped.

I set up a Java Bot that buys directly on the store and checks out in less than 10 seconds. It's a Java bot, it doesn't rely on a web browser, it works stand-alone and it's pretty effective. Cheers to the developer.

It has a neat interface and it's even not too hard to configure and get started with, and the price is fair!

Update: The Supreme website added a captcha on the checkout page to avoid bots like this, but the bot we are talking about is still on the grind, it integrates a captcha solving functionality that works pretty fine. Check out how it works on their [Blog](https://www.supremebot.co/supreme-bot-keywords-drop05/) page.

So for this thursday, cop or drop? ðŸ™‚
