The IDE dilemma, which one to use? There's a new guy in town.

Brackets from Adobe (<a href="http://brackets.io" title="http://brackets.io" target="_blank">http://brackets.io</a>) is a new text-editor made for front-end developers, it's completely written in javascript and comes with an ever-growing list of plugins to enhance your experience.

Right now i feel pretty good using Sublime Text, which is awesome, but I decided to give Brackets a try.

The most interesting feature of Brackets, differing from other text-editors, is it's capability to edit css rules directly inline, just select an HTML tag and press CMD+E and the css rule related to that element will popup and let you edit it on the fly! Awesome, isn't it?

Brackets also comes with a nice feature to show in the browser (just Chrome for now) your edits in real-time, you don't even have to save the file, you will see the result on the browser at the same time you type the code, amazing.

It also have a lot of features like popup for colors (to show what the hex code correspond to), img preview on hover, and a lot more.

To have a complete showcase of the current and future features visit <a href="http://brackets.io" title="Adobe Brackets" target="_blank">their website</a>, and why not, suggest your feature request!

I'm looking forward to see this product finished, I'm sure it will be awesome to use and very handy for us, front-end developers!
