Tired of struggling with all those hosting companies, server management, DNS configurations, and tedious tasks?

Here&#8217;s a smart solution to centralize them all if you have a developer mindset.

The folks at <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a> has made the implementation of virtual server completely effortless. You can create a virtual machine in something close to 55 seconds.

Then you have ssh access to your server and you can do whatever you want, as long as you know how to move inside a linux system, for only 5 bucks monthly!

Oh, almost forgot, you only pay for the bandwidth you actually use. Rad.

Give it a try!
