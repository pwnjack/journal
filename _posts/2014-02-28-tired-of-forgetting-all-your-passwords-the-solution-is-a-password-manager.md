Getting mad remembering your passwords? The solution is a good password manager.

Nowadays internet has reached a point where you have to register an account in almost every website, this way, you have a loooong password list to remember, and sometimes, when you don&#8217;t use them often, they are easy to forget. Using always the same password for all your accounts is not secure. Fortunately technology comes in hand, there are some super-useful programs out there to help you with this task.

The most famous is <a title="LastPass" href="https://lastpass.com/" target="_blank">LastPass</a>, but my personal choice is <a title="Dashlane" href="https://www.dashlane.com/" target="_blank">Dashlane</a>, very sleek and intuitive. Install it, it&#8217;s free, and it includes a premium membership trial of 30 days, the only huge difference of premium membership is the sync on all your devices, infact it also have a mobile app.

After installing it, you have to install also a browser plugin, and from now on it will automatically save your passwords at the time you register/first-login on a website. Dashlane features also an auto-compiler for the usual registration steps and for payments with credit cards. It also features a strong password generator. From now on you will never type a password again, it automatically logins once you login with the Dashlane master password.

Nice, isn&#8217;t it?

Don&#8217;t forget your master password, or you&#8217;ll never access your data again, because for security reason, your master password is not stored on the Dashlane cloud servers.
