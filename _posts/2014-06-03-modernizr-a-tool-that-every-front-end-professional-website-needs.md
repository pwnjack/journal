Modernizr is an awesome js plugin that helps front-end development bringing HTML5 markup elements to older browsers, and gives a powerfull api to interact with.

When you download Modernizr from <a href="http://modernizr.com/" title="Modernizr" target="_blank">his official website</a> you can customize it or use it straight to go, even if you are not gonna use it&#8217;s API you can simply connect the js file in your markup to have it&#8217;s default behaviors working.

It&#8217;s very useful because it can detect what feature the visitor&#8217;s browser have, and which not, this way you can manipulate your content, styling, targeting only specific browsers/versions using a very powerful and intuitive API.

Take a look at <a href="http://modernizr.com/docs/" title="Modernizr Docs" target="_blank">their website&#8217;s docs</a> to learn more.

I strongly suggest you to use it even in it&#8217;s default state, it resolves a lot of bugs with older versions browsers!

Cheers!
