I am a web designer and an hardcore videgamer too, at home i have a Windows computer for gaming and at the office i have an iMac. After more than 15 years using both here are some reasons why a Mac is quite better for working.

**Windows:**

Pros:  
Less expensive  
More Videogames

Cons:  
Very bad user permissions management  
Too long file name doesn't work (programmatically speaking this is a big deal)  
Setup a working environment is usually a pain and a lot time expensive  
Updates every day, seriously, every f\***ing day  
Virus vulnerable  
The OS is not built and designed for every hardware so all hardware configurations are compromise, not it's best  
Internet Explorer  
Long and messy installations, always getting unwanted software installed every time you install something if you don't pay attention to small and hidden checkboxes  
Less intuitive (for beginners)  
Silly filesystem incompatibilities with other devices

**Mac**

Pros:  
Unix based (this means rock solid)  
Almost no viruses  
Designed and built for exactly the hardware it contains, fully optimized  
A lot of integrated features without third-party software installations  
Built-in flexible screenshots capabilities  
Drag and drop installations  
Simple and intuitive even for beginners  
Powerful terminal shell (Unix rocks)  
Physically beautiful  
Free OS updates  
Built-in cloud based data storage

Cons:  
A lot expensive to buy and repair  
Few videogames  
Most software are for Windows first

This is all folksâ€¦ for now.

Comment below what you think about it.
