I am a web designer and an hardcore videgamer too, at home i have a Windows computer for gaming and at the office i have an iMac. After more than 15 years using both here are some reasons why a Mac is quite better for working.

### Windows:

Pros:  
- Less expensive  
- More Videogames

Cons:  
- Very bad user permissions management  
- Too long file name doesn't work (programmatically speaking this is a big deal)  
- Setup a working environment is usually a pain and a lot time expensive  
- Updates every day, seriously, every f\***ing day  
- Virus vulnerable  
- The OS is not built and designed for every hardware so all hardware configurations are compromise, not it's best  
- Internet Explorer  
- Long and messy installations, always getting unwanted software installed every time you install something if you don't pay attention to small and hidden checkboxes  
- Less intuitive (for beginners)  
- Silly filesystem incompatibilities with other devices

### Mac

Pros:  
- Unix based (this means rock solid)  
- Almost no viruses  
- Designed and built for exactly the hardware it contains, fully optimized  
- A lot of integrated features without third-party software installations  
- Built-in flexible screenshots capabilities  
- Drag and drop installations  
- Simple and intuitive even for beginners  
- Powerful terminal shell (Unix rocks)  
- Physically beautiful  
- Free OS updates  
- Built-in cloud based data storage

Cons:  
- A lot expensive to buy and repair  
- Few videogames  
- Most software are for Windows first

This is all folks… for now.

Comment below what you think about it.
