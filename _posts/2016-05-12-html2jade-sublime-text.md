Jade fan?

You are probably already using Sublime Text (if you don't, do.)

Tired of copy-pasting HTML snippets and then have to convert them to jade?

With [html2jade](https://github.com/anderson916/sublime-html2jade) converting HTML to Jade is a breeze.

You can:

- Convert whole HTML file Shift+Alt+F - creates new file in the same folder using the same name as the source ending with '.html'.  
- Convert selection Shift+Alt+S - replaces selection of HTML with JADE content.  
- Convert clipboard content Shift+Alt+V - inserts JADE of converted clipboard HTML content.

A real time saver.
