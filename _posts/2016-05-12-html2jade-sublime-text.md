Jade fan?

You are probably already using Sublime Text (if you don&#8217;t, do.)

Tired of copy-pasting HTML snippets and then have to convert them to jade?

With [html2jade](https://github.com/anderson916/sublime-html2jade) converting HTML to Jade is a breeze.

You can:

&#8211; Convert whole HTML file Shift+Alt+F &#8211; creates new file in the same folder using the same name as the source ending with &#8216;.html&#8217;.  
&#8211; Convert selection Shift+Alt+S &#8211; replaces selection of HTML with JADE content.  
&#8211; Convert clipboard content Shift+Alt+V &#8211; inserts JADE of converted clipboard HTML content.

A real time saver.
