Hey there,

I made <a title="gulpfile-bower" href="https://github.com/pwnjack/gulpfile-bower" target="_blank">this git</a> on github.

It's a complete guide to setup a working environment with a task manager (Gulp) and a Package Manager (Bower) and a configuration file (gulpfile), them together with this git you have a full working environment, you can use it straight to go or, obviously, you can make your own modifications to suit your workflow.

To better understand how it works and to get started with it read the git's documentation and follow the instructions!

Enjoy!
