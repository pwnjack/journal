Hey design folks,

You know <a title="Parallax JS" href="http://wagerfield.github.io/parallax" target="_blank">Parallax </a>right? The great plugin that allows you to build those sites where the background flows more slowly than the page creating a 3D-like effect? Well, actually it does a lot more but, just to have an idea.

The problem is that sometimes it's not that easy to setup and achieve the effect you imagined without digging in the documentaion spending hours of time that you usally don't have, but hey, there's an awesome plugin out there, based on Parallax, called <a title="Stellar JS" href="http://markdalgleish.com/projects/stellar.js" target="_blank">Stellar JS</a>.

Stellar is more straight to go.

    $.stellar().

Boom, you are done.

Now add a data attribute to any HTML element to setup the speed you want it to scroll at, keep in mind that the ratio is relative to the page's scroll speed.

Easy, isn't it? Go on and discover the potential of this awesome plugin and what you can do with it. You can find the detailed documentation right <a title="Stellar JS Documentation" href="http://markdalgleish.com/projects/stellar.js/docs" target="_blank">here</a>

Happy coding!
