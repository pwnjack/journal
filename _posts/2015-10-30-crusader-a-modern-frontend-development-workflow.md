I decided to move a crusade against the evil that dwells deeply inside the frontend development. I did it to convert the heretic HTML and CSS in more faithful, scalable, mantainable and flexible languages such as Jade, Sass, an so on.

If you are tired of fighting against static projects, that make you mad to make even a small change, follow this <a href="https://github.com/pwnjack/crusader" target="_blank">project</a> on github, once mastered it will give you a solid base to shape your workflow and make frontend development as painless as possible.

The Crusader comes in handy, giving you the right tools to convert even the most stubborn heretics to the faith of "convention over configuration".

If you wanna join my crusade, raise your sword, you are welcome.
